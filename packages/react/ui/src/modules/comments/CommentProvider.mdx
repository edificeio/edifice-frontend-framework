# Comments

`CommentProvider` component allows to add a comments section in your app

<Canvas of={commentStories.Base} />
{/* <Controls /> */}

## Comment

The structure of a comment object must conform to this interface. If not, you must transform your content before passing comments as a prop.

```
interface CommentProps {
  /**
   * Comment Id
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * Comment text
   */
  comment: string;
  /**
   * Author Id
   */
  authorId: string;
  /**
   * Name of the author of the comment
   */
  authorName: string;
  /**
   * Date when comment was created
   */
  createdAt: number;
  /**
   * Date when comment was updated
   */
  updatedAt?: number;
}
```

## Type prop

The `CommentProvider` expects a `type` prop with 1 of the following values:

```
CommentType = "read" | "edit";
```

It will determined if you authorize to create and edit comments or just to display a list of comments (e.g: print page)

## Creating a new comment

By passing `type='edit'` to the CommentProvider, it will expect the `comments` and `callbacks` props.

<Canvas of={commentStories.CreateComment} />

You need to pass an Event Handler to the `post` key in the `callbacks` prop to delete this comment.

```
post: (comment: string) => Promise<void>
```

## Update a comment

If you have a comment, you can update a comment by cliking on the Update button.

<Canvas of={commentStories.UpdateComment} />

You need to pass an Event Handler to the `put` key in the `callbacks` prop to update a comment.

```
put: ({comment, commentId}: {comment: string; commentId: string;}) => Promise<void>;
```

## Delete a comment

If you have a comment, you can remove this comment by cliking on the Delete button.

<Canvas of={commentStories.DeleteComment} />

You need to pass an Event Handler to the `delete` key in the `callbacks` prop to delete this comment.

```
delete: (commentId: string) => Promise<void>;
```

## Callbacks

As above, the `callbacks` prop needs 3 keys/methods to work: `post`, `put`, `delete` to create, update or remove a comment.

- The post method returns the newly created comment

```
post: (comment: string) => Promise<void>
```

- The put method returns the updated comment along with its ID

```
put: ({comment, commentId}: {comment: string; commentId: string;}) => Promise<void>;
```

- The delete method returns the commentId of the comment to be deleted.

```
delete: (commentId: string) => Promise<void>;
```

You can manage all three of these methods however you like in your code but need to be asynchrone.
For instance:

```
const handleOnPutcomment = async ({ comment, commentId }) => {
  await updateComment({ comment, commentId })
};
```

## Options

`CommentProvider` accepts a prop called `options` to configure its behaviour

<Canvas of={commentStories.OptionsComments} />

```
type CommentOptions = {
  /**
   * Setting the text limit on a comment
   */
  maxCommentLength: number;
  /**
   * Setting the text limit on a response
   */
  maxReplyLength: number;
  /**
   * Limit for displaying comments in the list
   */
  maxComments: number;
  /**
   * Number of comments to load additionally in the limited list
   */
  additionalComments: number;
  /**
   * Limit on displaying replies to a comment
   */
  maxReplies: number;
};
```

### Limit Comments

Configure `maxComments` with a number to limit the list of comments displayed and change the default value of `additionalComments` to add show more comments.

<Canvas of={commentStories.ReadMoreComments} />

## Read-only comments

By passing `type='read'` to the `CommentProvider`, it displays the comments and disables any interaction.

<Canvas of={commentStories.ReadComments} />
